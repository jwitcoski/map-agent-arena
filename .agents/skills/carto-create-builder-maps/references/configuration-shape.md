# Map configuration shape — JSON skeleton + dataset reference

The annotated tree below shows every top-level field the CLI accepts, plus per-dataset structure and `mapSettings` rules. For the authoritative field-level reference, run `carto maps schema [section]` (sections: `bundle`, `dataset`, `privacy`, `agent`, `mapstate`, `mapstyle`, `mapsettings`, `layer`, etc.).

## Top-level structure

```jsonc
{
  // Server-assigned; omit on create, present on update.
  "id": "uuid-from-maps-get",

  // Basic metadata. All optional. POST /maps only accepts title/description/keplerMapConfig;
  // tags/collaborative/agent land via the follow-up PATCH the CLI does for you.
  "title": "My map",
  "description": "Markdown, viewer-facing. See `SKILL.md` *Always-on rules → Do silently, don't ask → Description* for the authoring rule.",
  "collaborative": false,           // update-only. true → org users with Editor role can open in /builder (else /viewer). Orthogonal to privacy: privacy controls who sees the map, collaborative controls who of those can edit.
  "tags": ["demo", "poc"],          // update-only

  // Data sources. One per dataset the map references.
  // Identity: server id on existing datasets; omit id + use "$ref":"<name>" on new
  // datasets the kepler config will reference via "dataId":"$ref:<name>".
  "datasets": [
    {
      "$ref": "collisions",
      "type": "table",               // enum: table | tileset | query | raster
      "source": "carto-demo-data.demo_tables.nyc_collisions",
      "connectionId": "uuid-from-connections-list",
      "geoColumn": "geom",           // or "h3:h3" / "quadbin:quadbin" (pre-indexed) or "h3:geom" / "quadbin:geom" (dynamic binning)
      "columns": ["geom"],           // columns to fetch for rendering
      "format": "tilejson",          // `tilejson` for table/query/tileset, `raster` for raster. Legacy values (json/geojson/table/binary).
      "label": "NYC Collisions"
    }
  ],

  // Kepler.gl viz config. When present on an UPDATE this field is REPLACED
  // wholesale, not merged — send the full desired state every time.
  "keplerMapConfig": {
    "version": "v1",

      "basemapConfig":{ /* basemap (canonical) — see references/basemap.md */ },
      "mapStyle":     { /* basemap (legacy mirror) — must match basemapConfig.styleId */ },

      "sqlParameters": [ /* parameterized queries */ ],
      "mapSettings": { /* feature settings */ },
      // spatialFilter (optional): clips the rendered extent to a GeoJSON Feature
      // (usually a Polygon). Builder writes this when the viewer draws a lasso or
      // imports a boundary; programmatic authoring is rare. Round-trip-safe — preserve
      // as-is when reading + writing back. Omit on new maps unless clipping is the
      // central interaction. NOTE: `visState.filters[]` is a separate, legacy
      // post-fetch row-filter mechanism — for live filtering use SQL parameters
      // (`references/sql-parameters.md`); they re-run the query rather than filtering
      // already-fetched rows.
      "spatialFilter": null,
      // Split-map mode (optional). See *"Split-map mode"* section below — both
      // `mapState.isSplit` and `visState.splitMaps` must agree, and every layer
      // id in `visState.layers[]` must appear in BOTH side-entries' layer maps.
      // Layer groups (optional). Collapsible folders for the layer panel — a flat,
      // ordered array of {type:"layer",layerId} / {type:"group",…,children} entries.
      // Sibling of visState (NOT inside it); layers join a group via the group's
      // `children`, not a field on the layer. Omit for a flat list. See references/layers.md.
      "layerGrouping": []
    }
  },

  // Optional AI agent config. Full tree — omit the whole field to disable.
  "agent": {
    "enabledForViewer": false,
    "config": { /* see references/agent-config.md for the full tree */ }
  },

  // Privacy — CLI-level; maps to POST /maps/:id/privacy behind the scenes.
  "privacy": {
    "privacy": "private",            // private | shared | public
    "sharingScope": "organization"   // organization | specific (with sharing lists)
  }
}
```

Fields that are **server-computed and auto-stripped** by `maps get --json` so the output can be piped straight back into `create` / `update`: `accountId, ownerId, createdAt, thumbnailUrl, token, views, policies, publishedWithPassword, agent.token, agent.issues`, etc.

---

### Split-map mode

Builder's **split-map** view shows the same map in two side-by-side viewports with different per-side layer visibility — useful for before/after comparisons (year vs year, scenario vs scenario) where filtering rebinds the data and you want both states visible simultaneously.

State lives in **two coordinated places** under `keplerMapConfig.config`:

```jsonc
{
  "mapState": {
    "isSplit": true                    // viewport flag — must mirror splitMaps.length > 1
  },
  "visState": {
    "layers": [
      { "id": "L_2020", /* ... */ },
      { "id": "L_2024", /* ... */ }
    ],
    "splitMaps": [
      { "layers": { "L_2020": true,  "L_2024": false } },   // [0] = left  — shows 2020 only
      { "layers": { "L_2020": false, "L_2024": true  } }    // [1] = right — shows 2024 only
    ]
  }
}
```

**Authoring rules** — the CLI surfaces validation issues for each:

1. **`splitMaps.length === 2` ⇒ split active.** Length 0 / 1 / absent ⇒ single-pane.
2. **Every `visState.layers[].id` MUST appear in BOTH side-entries** as a key. Layers not listed render on neither side (silently hidden).
3. **All keys in `splitMaps[i].layers` MUST match an existing layer id.** Unknown ids are dropped by Builder; the side renders without that toggle.
4. **Values are booleans.** `true` ⇒ visible on this side. Strings / numbers fail validation.
5. **`mapState.isSplit` MUST equal `splitMaps.length > 1`.** Desyncs put the toolbar and the layout in disagreement (toolbar says split, layout single-pane, or vice versa).

**Round-trip behaviour.** `carto maps get <id> --json` preserves `splitMaps` faithfully. `carto maps create` / `update` accept it as long as the rules above hold; the CLI's pre-flight validation flags drift before the API call.

**When NOT to author split-map mode:**
- Single-layer maps (split with one layer is a UI no-op).
- Cases where toggling layers in the legend already does what you want (split is for *side-by-side simultaneous* viewing, not alternating).
- Pre-built tileset maps where left/right layers reference *different* tilesets — Builder's split sub-tree assumes both sides share the same source dataset; mixing sources tends to render only one side.

## Datasets — table / query / tileset / raster

Datasets live at `/maps/:id/datasets` — a sub-resource per map. The configuration's `datasets[]` is your declarative view of them.

### Choosing the source shape for H3 / quadbin maps — decision rubric

For aggregated layers (`h3` / `quadbin` / `heatmapTile` / `clusterTile`) there are two valid source shapes. Pick the right one before authoring — they have different gotchas, and it's easy to land on the wrong one.

| Source shape | Use when | Caveat |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw `table` / `query` + spatial-index `geoColumn` + `aggregationExp`** (dynamic binning — the tile server bins on the fly) | The source rows fit in a normal warehouse table and you control the SQL. The default for most CLI-authored maps. | `aggregationExp` MUST produce columns whose names match what `visualChannels.colorField` references via Builder's `<col>_<agg>` aliasing convention (see [`layers.md`](layers.md) *"h3 / quadbin source decision rubric"* and *"`aggregationExp` — let the CLI compose it"*). |
| **Pre-built `tileset`** (binned upstream by CARTO / a tileset-generation pipeline) | Billions of rows where dynamic binning would time out, OR a CARTO-curated tileset (Spatial Features, etc.). | `colorField.name` must match the **post-aggregation column inside the tile**, not the raw source-table column. The bridging convention from dynamic binning does NOT apply here — the rename has already happened upstream. **Always inspect the tilejson first** to learn the actual column names. |

**Default recommendation:** dynamic binning (raw table + `h3:` / `quadbin:` `geoColumn`) unless the table is genuinely too big to bin per-request.

> **Inspect tilejson before authoring against any pre-built tileset (raster, h3, quadbin).** The column catalogue isn't in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` — it's only in tilejson metadata. Run `carto connections describe <conn> <table>` to confirm the dataset is a tileset, then read the tilejson to see what columns exist (and at what aliases). Authoring blind to it produces silent blank renders. Same advice [`layers.md`](layers.md) gives for raster / h3 / quadbin pre-built tilesets — applies equally everywhere a tilejson is the source of truth.

### `type: "table"` — a full warehouse table

Works against any warehouse CARTO connects to — BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks, Postgres, Oracle. The `connectionId` picks the provider; `source` is just the fully-qualified identifier in that provider's syntax (`project.dataset.table` on BigQuery, `database.schema.table` on Snowflake / Redshift / Databricks / Postgres / Oracle).

```jsonc
{
  "$ref": "sources",
  "type": "table",
  "source": "carto-demo-data.demo_tables.nyc_collisions",   // FQN, no backticks
  "connectionId": "<uuid>",                                  // `carto connections list`
  "geoColumn": "geom",
  "columns": ["geom"],
  "format": "tilejson",
  "label": "NYC Collisions"
}
```

**When to use:** the table exists in the warehouse and is sized reasonably (< a few GB).
**Gotchas:** the column list bounds what the map *can ever show*. If you want tooltips with other columns, include them here too.

### `type: "query"` — a SQL query as the source

```jsonc
{
  "$ref": "top-brands",
  "type": "query",
  "source": "SELECT brand, geom, sales FROM `project.ds.sales_points` WHERE year = 2025",
  "connectionId": "<uuid>",
  "geoColumn": "geom",
  "columns": ["brand", "geom", "sales"],
  "format": "tilejson",
  "label": "Top brands 2025"
}
```

**When to use:** filtering, joining, computing columns, or piping a warehouse view. The most common shape in real maps.
**Gotchas:** the query is re-run on every pan/zoom with a bbox injected. Avoid expensive joins; pre-aggregate where possible.

### `format` values

The backend enum still carries six values — `json | table | geojson | binary | tilejson | raster` — for backwards compatibility with maps created before the move to dynamic tiling. **Only two of them are authored by modern Builder today**:

| dataset.type | `format` to emit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `table` | `tilejson` | Dynamic tiling — Builder writes this for every new table dataset. |
| `query` | `tilejson` | Same — tiles are generated from the SQL result. |
| `tileset` | `tilejson` | Pre-built CARTO tileset. |
| `raster` | `raster` | Always. Mismatches (e.g. `raster` + `tilejson`) are tolerated by the API but produce undefined tile-server behaviour. |

**Rule for agents authoring new datasets: `tilejson` or `raster`. Nothing else.** Builder's own frontend enum doesn't even include `table` or `binary`, and it writes only `TILEJSON` / `RASTER` for new datasets. `json` is the backend's document-mode path (loaded via the SQL API for legacy maps) and was migrated out when Builder moved to dynamic tiling. `geojson`, `binary`, and `table` are similarly vestigial.

**Editing legacy maps**: if `maps get --json` returns a dataset with a legacy `format`, pass it through unchanged on update — stripping or changing it would break the existing map. Only create *new* datasets with `tilejson` / `raster`.

**Why the Tier-1 validator still accepts the legacy values**: so legacy maps still survive `get | update` without manual fix-up. The corresponding legacy *layer* types (`point`, `geojson`, `line`, `s2`, `hexagonId`, `grid`, `hexagon`, `heatmap`, `cluster`, `trip`) are rejected on create/update because Builder migrated them to `unknown` during the document-mode-to-dynamic-tiling move.

### `type: "tileset"` — a pre-built CARTO tileset

```jsonc
{
  "$ref": "buildings",
  "type": "tileset",
  "source": "cartobq.public_tilesets.osm_buildings_v2",
  "connectionId": "<uuid>",
  "geoColumn": null,                                   // tilesets self-describe geometry
  "columns": null,
  "format": "tilejson",
  "label": "Global buildings"
}
```

**When to use:** billions-of-rows datasets (AIS, OSM). Pre-tiled, very fast.

### Spatial indexes (H3, quadbin)

The warehouse column holds an index integer, and `geoColumn` uses a prefix:

```jsonc
// H3 aggregation with per-cell metrics
{
  "$ref": "infra",
  "type": "query",
  "source": "SELECT h3, sum(gens) as gens_sum, max(temp) as temp_max FROM infra GROUP BY h3",
  "connectionId": "<uuid>",
  "geoColumn": "h3:h3",                  // prefix ":colname" marks the spatial index type
  "format": "tilejson",
  "aggregationExp": "sum(gens_sum) as gens_sum,max(temp_max) as temp_max",
  "aggregationResLevel": 4,              // resolution when zooming out
  "label": "Power infra (H3)"
}

// Quadbin raster aggregation
{
  "$ref": "elev",
  "type": "table",
  "source": "raster.dataset.elevation",
  "connectionId": "<uuid>",
  "geoColumn": "quadbin:quadbin",
  "format": "tilejson",
  "aggregationExp": "avg(band_1_int16) as band_1_int16_average",
  "aggregationResLevel": 9,
  "label": "Elevation"
}
```

**Reading the geoColumn prefix:**
- `geom` / `point_geom` / any plain name → regular geometry column
- `h3:<colname>` → H3 cell index in `<colname>`. Canonical pre-indexed form is `h3:h3`; for dynamic binning from a raw geometry column, pass the raw column name (typically `h3:geom`).
- `quadbin:<colname>` → quadbin index in `<colname>`. Canonical pre-indexed form is `quadbin:quadbin`; for dynamic binning, pass the raw column name (typically `quadbin:geom`).

**`aggregationExp` / `aggregationResLevel`** are required for **dynamically-binned** spatial-index datasets (`type: "query"` / `"table"` with a `h3:` / `quadbin:` geoColumn prefix) and must be consistent with the layer type below. They are **NOT required** — and not used — when `dataset.type === "tileset"` and the tileset is pre-indexed (the tileset metadata carries the binning). Tier-1 skips the check in that case.

> **Dynamic H3 / quadbin binning requires POINT geometries.** The tile server's dynamic-binning path internally calls `H3_FROMGEOGPOINT` / `QUADBIN_FROMGEOGPOINT`, which reject any non-POINT input (polygons, lines). When the source is polygons, Builder rejects the tilejson with a misleading `"Aggregation resolution level can't be greater than the resolution of the spatial indexes in the table"` error that blames the wrong thing — an LLM reading it obediently tries lowering `aggregationResLevel` and the error stays. The real fix is either **(a)** wrap the source SQL with `ST_CENTROID(<col>)` — `SELECT ST_CENTROID(geom) AS geom FROM ...` — or **(b)** pre-compute the spatial index upstream: `SELECT H3_FROMGEOGPOINT(ST_CENTROID(geom), <res>) AS h3, COUNT(*) ... GROUP BY h3` + `geoColumn: "h3:h3"`. Tier-1 catches this when the configuration declares a non-POINT `dataset.geomType`; when the hint is absent, the `verifyRender` step translates the misleading tile-server error into a message that names the POINT constraint and the workarounds.

### Ref syntax — how `dataId` / `dataSource` / `sqlParameters[].dataSources[].id` point at a dataset

Two forms, nothing else:

- `"$ref:<name>"` — declare the name once on the dataset (`"$ref": "<name>"`) and reference it from layers / widgets / SQL parameters.
- A real dataset UUID — when you're editing a map that already exists and you know the id (typically via `maps get --json`).

There is **no `@name` or `#name` shorthand**. Tier-1 validation rejects unresolved refs and dangling ids loudly — if you see `UNRESOLVED_REF` or `Dangling data reference`, the typo is your cue.

## Source capabilities — columns, cache, mapSettings

Every dataset sits at the intersection of three things: the **warehouse** (via `connectionId`), the **data** (via `source` + optional SQL parameter binding), and the **rendering pipeline** (via `format`, `geoColumn`, `aggregationExp`, etc). This section maps every useful field on a dataset, grouped by what it controls.

### What's on a dataset

Full per-field reference: `carto maps schema dataset`. Key ones:

- `connectionId`, `source`, `type`, `format` are required.
- `geoColumn` uses the `h3:<col>` / `quadbin:<col>` prefix pattern to mark spatial indexes.
- `aggregationExp` + `aggregationResLevel` are required for h3/quadbin datasets **when the dataset is `table` or `query`** (dynamic binning). For pre-indexed tilesets (`dataset.type: "tileset"`), the binning is baked into the tileset metadata — don't set these fields, the CLI doesn't require them, and the tile server ignores anything you pass.
- `queryTemplate` + `queryParameters` turn on the SQL-parameters flow (see [`sql-parameters.md`](sql-parameters.md)).
- `uniqueIdProperty` enables cross-tile feature highlighting.

### Dataset type × layer type matrix (always `format: "tilejson"`)

| Dataset `type` | Compatible layer types |
|---|---|
| `table` | `tileset` (any geom), `h3` (if `geoColumn: "h3:…"`), `quadbin` |
| `query` | `tileset`, `h3`, `quadbin`, `heatmapTile` |
| `tileset` | `tileset` only (it's pre-tiled by the provider) |
| `raster` | `quadbin` (raster sources aggregate into quadbin cells) |

### `columns` — what to ask the warehouse for

The `columns` array controls which fields the backend fetches per tile. Include only what you'll use — popups, visualChannels, widgets, filters. Fewer columns = smaller payload = faster tiles.

Three traps to avoid:
1. **Widgets referencing columns not in `columns`** render blank. Include the column on the dataset even if no layer uses it.
2. **SQL parameters that reference columns** must still be in `columns`.
3. **The geometry column** must be included (and also named in `geoColumn`).

For `tileset`-type datasets, `columns: null` means "let the tileset's own schema dictate". Once the active normalisation bug is fixed this is the safe default; **until then, prefer an explicit `columns: [...]` even on tilesets** — list every column referenced by `visualChannels` (colorField, heightField, sizeField, etc.), `popupSettings.layers[*].fields[]`, widgets, and the geometry column. Small upfront cost, eliminates the silent-strip class of failures (3D enabled with nothing extruded, popups enabled with no fields).

> **`columns: []` edge case on PATCH.** Sending an empty array is not the same as `null`: Builder's dataset PATCH handler gates the update with `if (columns)`, which treats `[]` as falsy in some backend paths. To clear the column list, **omit the field**; to set a subset, send the explicit array.

### Workflow-sourced datasets

Datasets produced by the "Create map from workflow node" command carry two provenance fields: `sourceWorkflowId` and `sourceWorkflowNodeId`. Both are **server-assigned** — clients cannot set them to an arbitrary value. PATCH accepts them only to **clear** them (set to null), disconnecting the map from the workflow. Pass them through unchanged on `maps get | maps update`; otherwise leave them undefined.

### Spatial index datasets (`h3` / `quadbin`)

When a dataset holds a spatial index column (H3 cell id or quadbin id), Builder streams aggregated cells instead of raw rows. You configure this with:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "query",
  "source": "SELECT h3_id as h3, SUM(events) as events FROM `proj.ds.agg` GROUP BY h3_id",
  "geoColumn": "h3:h3",
  "aggregationExp": "sum(events) as events_sum",
  "aggregationResLevel": 4,
  "format": "tilejson",
  "connectionId": "<id>"
}
```

**`aggregationExp` combines cells when zooming out**: the server aggregates adjacent cells into a lower-resolution cell using the expression. If your source table is already at resolution 9 but the user zooms out, the server uses `aggregationExp` to compute a single value for each parent cell.

**`aggregationResLevel`** is the *target* resolution Builder shows when fully zoomed out. Too low = coarse, too high = slow. **Stay within Builder's UI selector range** — H3: `[1, 6]` (default 4); quadbin: `[1, 9]` (default 6). Tier-1 rejects values outside the range; configurations outside it would render but the user couldn't subsequently adjust the resolution from the Builder UI (the slider is bounded). The H3 cap is *visual-design*, not a warehouse limit — the H3 system supports up to res 15, but cells smaller than ~0.1 km² stop being useful for thematic maps. Pre-indexed tilesets are exempt (the binning is baked at upload time).

Key pattern: the columns produced by `aggregationExp` (aliased with `as …_sum`, `as …_max`) are what layers reference via `visualChannels.colorField` — they don't exist in the raw table.

### Cache / refresh — the only knobs that exist

On `keplerMapConfig.config.mapSettings`:

```jsonc
"mapSettings": {
  "cacheTime": 5,            // minutes (integer). default 0. Ignored unless controlCacheTime=true.
  "controlCacheTime": true   // boolean. Enables the cacheTime behavior.
}
```

**Semantics** (mirrored from Builder's layer-type picker):
- When `controlCacheTime: true` and `cacheTime > 0`, Builder computes `lastRefreshAt = Date.now() - cacheTime*60*1000` on each dataset and sends `Cache-Control: max-age=<age>` on subsequent tile requests. That tells the CDN/service layer "don't hand me anything older than this."
- When `controlCacheTime: false`, service defaults apply (whatever the CDN set).
- The unit is **minutes**.
- There is **no polling**, **no auto-refresh**, **no TTL on the dataset itself** — these are the only cache/refresh primitives.

Typical values: `5` for "pretty fresh" dashboards, `60` for "hourly snapshots", `1440` (1 day) for "archives".

### `uniqueIdProperty` — for linking widgets/filters/popups

If your dataset has a column that uniquely identifies each feature (e.g. `collision_id`), set `uniqueIdProperty: "collision_id"`. Builder uses this to link clicks/hovers to the right row across widgets and tooltips. Without it, Builder falls back to generating synthetic ids per tile, which breaks cross-tile feature highlighting.

### Other mapSettings worth knowing

18 feature settings on `keplerMapConfig.config.mapSettings` — 15 boolean flags plus `cacheTime` (integer minutes), `measurementUnit` (`kilometers`|`miles`), and `exportDataSettings` (per-dataset export allowlist). Cosmetic / behavioural, not data-affecting, generally safe to copy wholesale. For the authoritative list with defaults, run `carto maps schema mapsettings`.

**Defaults**: almost everything is `false` by default. Only `scrollWheelZoom` defaults to `true` and `measurementUnit` defaults to `'kilometers'`. Set the rest explicitly if you want them on in a public viewer (`exportPDF`, `basemapsSelector`, `showMeasureDistanceTool`, `showMyLocationButton`, etc.). `cacheTime` is in **minutes** and only kicks in when `controlCacheTime: true`.

**Authoring rule — propose the END-USER features that match the map's purpose, in plain language.** These flags are NOT authoring config. They're what the viewer (the *end user* of the map — analyst, exec, or public-link reader) gets in their toolbar and right-side panel when they open the link. The Builder UI calls them *"Map options"* and presents them as a creator's choice of what to expose. CLI-authored maps that skip this whole block ship a stripped-down public map by default — fewer tools than the equivalent Builder-authored map.

**Don't ask the user a generic *"which of these?"* checklist.** They don't know what each flag does for their viewers. Instead: explain in plain language what each feature gives the END USER, propose a sensible set based on the map's purpose (collaborative review map, analytical exploration map, executive presentation, public publish), and let the user accept or refine. One short prompt, framed in viewer-experience terms, not flag names.

| `mapSettings` flag | What you tell the user (plain language) | Propose ON when |
|---|---|---|
| `comments` | *"Lets viewers and guests leave threaded comments on the map — useful for collaborative review. Limited to viewer/guest accounts only (not all roles); pair with sharing if you want a wider audience to comment."* | Map is collaborative-looking — team review, iterative feedback, *"what do you think?"* reviews. |
| `exportPDF` | *"Adds an Export to PDF button so viewers can grab a snapshot for slides or a report."* | Map is going to a stakeholder who needs a deliverable. |
| `exportViewportData` | *"Adds an Export data button so analysts can download the rows currently visible (CSV / GeoJSON / Shapefile / Parquet)."* Refine per-dataset with `exportDataSettings.datasets[<id>]` (allowlist columns/formats; omit to allow all). | Analytical map where the audience will want to take rows out for further work. |
| `showMeasureDistanceTool` | *"Ruler tool for measuring distance / area on the map."* `measurementUnit` picks km vs miles. | Field-operations / planning maps where viewers measure on-the-fly. |
| `featureSelectionTool` | *"Lasso tool — viewers draw a polygon and the map filters to features inside it. Lets the audience drill into a region without writing SQL."* | Exploratory analytical maps where viewers will want to slice by area. |
| `addressSearchBar` | *"Search bar in the toolbar that jumps the map to a place — accepts addresses (`'1600 Pennsylvania Ave'`) AND raw coordinates (`'40.71, -74.00'` or `'40.71°N, 74.00°W'`)."* Geocoding for addresses; coordinate-parse for lat/lng inputs. | Any map where viewers might navigate to a known place rather than pan/zoom — defaults to ON for most public/operational maps. |
| `basemapsSelector` | *"Lets viewers swap the basemap (light ↔ dark ↔ satellite) from the toolbar."* | Mixed-audience maps (some viewers prefer dark, some need satellite for context). |
| `reorderLayers` | *"Lets viewers re-stack the legend layers (drag-reorder) to see what's underneath."* | **MUST be ON whenever the map carries an `agent` block** — the Agent can add datasets / layers on the user's behalf but can't control z-order, so viewers need the freedom to restack themselves. Otherwise, propose ON for any multi-layer map (≥ 2 layers); skip on single-layer maps where there's nothing to reorder. |
| `showMyLocationButton` | *"Toolbar button that uses the browser's location service to centre the map on the viewer's current location."* | Field / mobile audiences. |
| `showTitlePublicMap` | *"Renders the map title in the public-viewer toolbar."* Without it the public link opens with a blank header. | **Default ON whenever `privacy: "public"`** — anonymous viewers need to see what they're looking at. |
| `showPerformanceWarnings` | *"Toast banners that warn viewers when a dataset is slow to load or render."* | Internal / dev / debug only — strip for stakeholder-facing maps; the warnings read as bugs to non-technical audiences. |

**Defaults that don't need a prompt** — apply silently:

- `reorderLayers: true` whenever the bundle has `agent` set (locked-in requirement, not negotiable).
- `showTitlePublicMap: true` whenever the bundle's `privacy: "public"`.
- `showPerformanceWarnings: false` on every public / shared map (only internal / dev maps want them).

**Round-trip preservation.** Maps read out via `get --json` already carry the creator's choices. **Don't strip them on `update`** — preserve the existing `mapSettings` object as-is unless the user explicitly asked to change it.
