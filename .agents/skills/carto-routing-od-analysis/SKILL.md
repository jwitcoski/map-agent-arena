# Routing and Origin-Destination Analysis

Builds CARTO Workflows that compute routes, travel time/distance matrices, and isoline catchment areas. Supports driving and walking modes. Also covers OD flow pattern analysis using spatial indexing.

**Prerequisites**: Load `carto-create-workflow` for the development process, JSON structure, and validation commands.

---

## Instructions

Three main workflow patterns exist. Choose based on the use case:

| Pattern | Component | Use when |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Isoline/Isochrone | `native.isolines` | You need catchment polygons around locations (e.g. "everywhere reachable within 10 min") |
| OD Matrix | `native.routesodmatrix` | You need travel time/distance between every origin-destination pair (analytics, no geometry) |
| Route Creation | `native.routes` | You need actual route line geometries between OD pairs (visualization, detailed path) |

---

### Pattern A: Isoline/Isochrone Generation

Pipeline:
```
Source Points -> (Filter) -> Isolines -> (Polyfill / Enrich) -> Save
```

#### Step A1: Load Source Points

Use `native.gettablebyname` to load locations (stores, stations, facilities).

**Success**: Table with a geometry column and a unique location identifier.

#### Step A2: Generate Isolines

Use `native.isolines` with:

| Input | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `mode` | Travel mode | `car` or `walk` |
| `range_type` | What the range measures | `time` or `distance` |
| `range` | Threshold value | Seconds for time (e.g. `600` = 10 min), meters for distance (e.g. `5000` = 5 km) |

**Success**: Each input point has an associated polygon geometry representing the reachable area.

#### Step A3: Post-Processing (optional)

Common follow-ups after isoline generation:
- **Polyfill + Enrich**: Convert isoline polygons to H3 with `native.h3polyfill`, then enrich with demographics or POI data (see trade-area-analysis skill).
- **Overlap analysis**: Use `native.spatialjoin` to find which isolines overlap, identifying areas served by multiple locations.
- **Coverage union**: Use `native.dissolve` to merge all isoline polygons into a single coverage footprint.

#### Step A4: Save

Use `native.saveastable` to persist isoline polygons or enriched results.

**Success**: Validated workflow uploadable via `carto workflows create`.

### Pattern B: OD Matrix (Travel Time/Distance)

Pipeline:
```
Origins Table -> ┐
                 ├-> OD Matrix -> (Filter/Aggregate) -> Save
Destinations Table -> ┘
```

#### Step B1: Load Origins and Destinations

Use two `native.gettablebyname` nodes -- one for origins, one for destinations. Both need geometry columns.

**Success**: Two tables, each with point geometries and unique identifiers.

#### Step B2: Compute OD Matrix

Use `native.routesodmatrix` with:

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `mode` | `car` or `walk` |
| Origins input | Connected from the origins table node |
| Destinations input | Connected from the destinations table node |

**Output columns**: `origin_id`, `destination_id`, `duration_s`, `distance_m`.

**Success**: One row per origin-destination pair with travel time and distance.

#### Step B3: Filter or Aggregate (optional)

Common post-processing:
- **Nearest destination**: Use `native.groupby` to find the minimum `duration_s` per origin, then join back to get the nearest destination.
- **Threshold filter**: Use `native.where` to keep only pairs within a time/distance limit (e.g. `duration_s < 1800` for 30-min threshold).
- **Accessibility score**: Count destinations reachable within a threshold per origin using `native.groupby`.

#### Step B4: Save

Use `native.saveastable`.

**Success**: Validated workflow uploadable via `carto workflows create`.

---

### Pattern C: Route Geometries

Pipeline:
```
Origins Table -> ┐
                 ├-> Routes -> Save
Destinations Table -> ┘
```

#### Step C1: Load Origins and Destinations

Same as Pattern B -- two `native.gettablebyname` nodes with point geometries.

#### Step C2: Compute Routes

Use `native.routes` with:

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `mode` | `car` or `walk` |
| Origins input | Connected from the origins table node |
| Destinations input | Connected from the destinations table node |

**Output**: Route line geometries with `duration_s` and `distance_m` attributes.

**Success**: One route geometry per OD pair, visualizable on a map.

#### Step C3: Save

Use `native.saveastable`.

**Success**: Validated workflow uploadable via `carto workflows create`.

---

### Pattern D: OD Flow Analysis (Grid-Based)

For analyzing trip/movement patterns at scale (e.g. taxi trips, bike rides, commute flows) without calling routing APIs.

Pipeline:
```
Trip Data -> H3 (origin) + H3 (destination) -> Group By (origin_h3, dest_h3) -> Save
```

#### Step D1: Load Trip Data

Use `native.gettablebyname`. The table should have both origin and destination coordinates (e.g. pickup_lon/lat, dropoff_lon/lat).

#### Step D2: Index Origins and Destinations to H3

Use `native.selectexpression` to compute H3 cells for both origin and destination points:
- Origin H3: derive from pickup coordinates
- Destination H3: derive from dropoff coordinates

Alternatively, if the data has separate geometry columns, use `native.h3frompoint` for each.

#### Step D3: Aggregate Flows

Use `native.groupby` to count trips per (origin_h3, destination_h3) pair:
- **Group by**: `origin_h3, destination_h3`
- **Aggregation**: `origin_h3,count` (trip count per OD pair)

**Success**: One row per unique OD cell pair with trip count -- ready for flow visualization.

#### Step D4: Save

Use `native.saveastable`.

## Gotchas

- **Provider casing & SQL dialect.** This skill uses lowercase column names (`origin_id`, `destination_id`, `duration_s`, `distance_m`, `origin_h3`, etc.) — BigQuery / Databricks / Postgres / Redshift convention. On Snowflake, reference these UPPERCASE (`ORIGIN_ID`, `DURATION_S`, ...). See `carto-create-workflow/references/providers/<provider>.md` for casing rules and SQL dialect equivalents.
- Isolines and routing components consume **LDS (Location Data Services) quota**. Check available quota with `LDS_QUOTA_INFO` before bulk operations. Buffers (`native.buffer`) do not consume LDS quota and are a free alternative for simple circular catchments.
- OD matrices grow **quadratically**: N origins x M destinations = N*M rows. Filter or sample inputs to keep the matrix manageable. For 1000 origins x 1000 destinations, you get 1 million rows.
- **Walking mode** has a much shorter practical range than driving. Walking isolines beyond 20-30 minutes or OD matrices beyond a few kilometers produce unreliable or empty results.
- **Route geometries can be large**. For pure analytics (time/distance only), prefer the OD matrix (Pattern B) over full routes (Pattern C) to reduce data volume.
- **Time-of-day** affects driving results due to congestion. Specify `departure_time` if the component supports it; otherwise results reflect typical/average conditions.
- **Isoline polygons may overlap** for nearby locations. If enriching afterwards, polyfill to a spatial index and deduplicate cells to avoid double-counting.
- For **OD flow visualization** (Pattern D), use H3 cell center points rather than raw coordinates for cleaner aggregation and visualization. A coarser resolution (e.g. H3 res 7-8) produces more meaningful flow patterns than fine resolutions.
- The LDS routing components require a **connection with LDS API access enabled**. Validation may fail if the connection lacks this permission.

## Common Variations

| Variant | How |
|---------|-----|
| Service area coverage | Isolines (car, multiple ranges e.g. 5/10/15 min) -> union -> measure total population covered |
| Nearest facility | OD matrix -> group by origin -> min(duration_s) -> join back to get nearest destination ID |
| Accessibility scoring | OD matrix -> filter by threshold -> count destinations per origin -> score by reachable count |
| Fleet route planning | Routes between depot and delivery points -> aggregate total distance/time per route |
| Commute flow analysis | Trip data -> H3 origin + H3 destination -> group by OD pair -> count -> visualize top flows |
| Multi-modal comparison | Run isolines twice (car + walk) -> compare coverage polygons -> identify transit-dependent areas |
