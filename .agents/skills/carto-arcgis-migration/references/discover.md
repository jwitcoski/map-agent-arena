# Phase A — Discover (Portal/AGOL → MIGRATION_MANIFEST.md)

A migration starts here. Given an ArcGIS Portal or ArcGIS Online endpoint plus credentials, this phase walks the agent through enumerating every relevant item, classifying it by type, and writing a markdown manifest that the data and maps phases consume.

The output — `MIGRATION_MANIFEST.md` in the working directory — is the source of truth for the rest of the migration. The agent updates per-item state as the later phases run.

## Prerequisites

- Authenticated `carto` CLI (`carto auth login`) with at least one connection in `carto connections list` — needed for the manifest to record the migration target.
- Access to an ArcGIS Portal or ArcGIS Online endpoint, plus credentials (or anonymous access for fully public AGOL items). See [`discover/extraction-tools.md`](discover/extraction-tools.md) for auth patterns.

## When to run this phase

- Starting a fresh migration: the user names a Portal/AGOL URL.
- Re-running discovery on the same Portal after content changes — the manifest is regenerated, preserving any items already marked `done`.
- Replanning before a partial migration: the user asks for a manifest filtered to a single user / group / folder.

## Phases

Follow these in order on every run.

### A.1 — Connect

1. Confirm the portal URL with the user. Trim trailing slashes; the `/sharing/rest` suffix is implicit.
2. Determine auth: token, username/password, or anonymous (public AGOL only). Read tokens from env (`ARCGIS_TOKEN`) before prompting.
3. Validate with one REST call: `GET <portal>/sharing/rest/portals/self?f=json`. A populated `user` object in the response means auth works.
4. Confirm the CARTO target: the user must name an existing CARTO connection. Run `carto connections list --json` to enumerate. Defer warehouse-target choice to the user; do not auto-pick.

### A.2 — Enumerate

1. Decide enumeration scope with the user: org-owned items (default), shared content, a specific group, a specific user, or a specific folder. Default is "items the authenticated user owns plus shared org content."
2. Page through the source. Pick the tool silently per [`discover/extraction-tools.md`](discover/extraction-tools.md): `arcgis` Python (`gis.content.search`) when installed; otherwise `curl` + `jq` against `/sharing/rest/search`. Continue paging until `nextStart == -1`.
3. For each item, capture: `id`, `title`, `type`, `typeKeywords`, `owner`, `created`, `modified`, `url` (when present), `size`, `numViews`, and any `dependencies` you can resolve from `relatedItems` or per-type detail calls (e.g. a Web Map's operationalLayers reveal which Feature Services it depends on).
4. Persist the raw responses to a sidecar file `MIGRATION_INVENTORY.json` in the working directory so downstream phases can re-read item details without re-hitting the REST API.

### A.3 — Classify

For each item, look up its `type` (and supplementary `typeKeywords` when needed) in [`discover/item-types.md`](discover/item-types.md). Each type maps to one of:

- A downstream phase: data migration (Datasets), maps migration (Web Maps), service migration, or app migration.
- A gap entry, with reason: `out-of-scope-v1`, `no-CARTO-equivalent`, or `manual-only`.
- An unknown-type entry (the type isn't in the reference). Surface these to the user explicitly — they may indicate a customization.

For Dashboard, Web Experience, and Web Mapping Application items, classification has a second step: fetch the item's `data` payload and apply the routing rubric in [`discover/app-routing-rubric.md`](discover/app-routing-rubric.md). The rubric chooses between **maps migration** (simple apps absorbed into the embedded Web Map's Builder map) and **app migration** (custom apps with widgets Builder doesn't cover or layouts denser than 4 widgets). Record `App profile`, `Max visible widgets`, `Routing decision`, and (for `builder` decisions) `Source Web Map` on the manifest entry per [`discover/manifest-format.md`](discover/manifest-format.md).

Track inter-item dependencies. A Web Map references Feature Services; an ArcGIS Dashboard references both maps and feature services. Record dependencies on each entry so downstream phases migrate in the right order.

### A.4 — Dedup datasets

A single underlying dataset can be exposed through multiple service-type items (Feature Service + Map Service + WFS + OGCFeatureServer pointing at the same rows). Collapse these into one Datasets entry before writing the manifest, so the data phase runs once per logical dataset.

Detection priority (per [`discover/manifest-format.md`](discover/manifest-format.md) "Dataset deduplication"):

1. **`serviceItemId` cross-reference**: fetch each service's `?f=json` metadata; group items whose `serviceItemId` references the same source item.
2. **URL-path heuristic**: strip the service-type token (`FeatureServer` / `MapServer` / `WFSServer`) and group items with identical remaining paths. Confirm with the user before collapsing unless the match is exact.

For each alias group, pick the canonical entry by preference order: Feature Service > Map Service > WFS > OGCFeatureServer. Move the others into `Source aliases:` on the canonical entry. **Do not duplicate them as separate Service entries** — that's the most common mistake on real portals and produces three migrations of the same data.

When a Web Map / Dashboard / app references a service URL belonging to a collapsed alias, resolve the dependency to the canonical entry's title in `Depends on:` — not the alias URL.

### A.5 — Write the manifest

Emit `MIGRATION_MANIFEST.md` in the working directory using the schema in [`discover/manifest-format.md`](discover/manifest-format.md). Sections (in order): Datasets, Web Maps, Services, Apps, Gaps. Each new entry starts in state `pending`.

If `MIGRATION_MANIFEST.md` already exists, read it first and preserve `state: done` and per-item `Target …` fields for items still present at the source. New items are appended in their section. Items removed at the source are commented out, not deleted.

### A.6 — Summarize

Print a short summary in the chat: counts per section, any gaps, dependencies the agent will need to walk during migration. Then stop. Let the user review the manifest before invoking the data or maps phases.

## Always-on rules (discover)

- **Pass `--json`** on every `carto` invocation; pass `&f=json` on every ArcGIS REST call.
- **Inspect silently, don't ask.** Tool selection (`arcgis` Python vs. `curl`+`jq`), pagination details, item-type lookups — all are agent decisions, not user-facing questions.
- **Never invent item ids or types.** All classifications come from the source `/search` response. If a type is unfamiliar, classify as a gap with `unknown type: <type>` and surface to the user.
- **Don't migrate during discovery.** This phase writes the manifest only. The user reviews before the agent runs the data or maps phases.
- **Idempotent re-runs.** The manifest accumulates state; re-running discover preserves done/skipped entries for items still at the source.
- **Dedup datasets**: never produce two Datasets entries (or one Datasets entry plus one Service entry) for the same underlying data. Apply A.4 detection on every run. The user only wants one CARTO table per logical dataset, regardless of how many ArcGIS items front it.
- **Always inspect apps.** Never route a Dashboard, Web Experience, or Web Mapping Application to the app-migration path without first applying the routing rubric and recording an explicit reason — either an unsupported widget or > 4 visible widgets — in `Notes` on the manifest entry. Default to the maps-migration path whenever the rubric allows. For Web Mapping Application, identify the subtype via `typeKeywords` (`Configurable` / `Instant App` / `WAB2D` / `WAB3D`) before reading the data payload.
- **Stop on auth failure.** If the portal returns 401/403, ask the user for fresh credentials. Do not retry silently.

## When in doubt

- Item type isn't in [`discover/item-types.md`](discover/item-types.md)? Classify as gap with `unknown type: <type>` and call it out in the summary.
- Portal returns >10 K items? Confirm scope with the user before enumerating — they likely want a filtered run.
- A Web Map references a Feature Service that isn't in the user's org? Record it as an external dependency on the map's entry; flag for the user (downstream migrations may fail to resolve it).
