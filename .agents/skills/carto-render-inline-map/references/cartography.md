# Cartography reference — for `view_map` deck.gl declarative specs

> **This is a reference, not a standalone skill.** Read alongside the `carto-render-inline-map` `SKILL.md` when composing a `view_map` spec that needs cartographic decisions. The `view_map` tool description carries the *syntax* (layer-source compatibility, `aggregationExp`, `@@function` shapes, expression-eval restrictions). This file layers *what to pick* on top — palette, scale, basemap, stroke, drawing order, hierarchy, picking, anti-patterns — once the agent knows *how to encode*.

> **Different from `carto-create-builder-maps/references/cartography.md`.** That reference is for Builder/kepler-config maps authored via the CLI. The shapes don't transfer to deck.gl declarative — they target a different runtime.

> **Different from `carto-develop-app/references/layers.md`.** That skill targets developers writing TypeScript/JavaScript app code with full `@deck.gl/carto` access (auth, scaffolds, React/Vue, full deck.gl surface including `Math.*` and arbitrary layers). This file targets agents emitting the `@deck.gl/json` declarative spec consumed by the `view_map` MCP tool — restricted to CARTO classes registered in the JSONConverter and the `@@=` expression-eval engine.

> The cartographic *principles* are the same across all three contexts; the *encodings* are not.

> **Only CARTO layers and primitives.** `view_map` accepts only the layers/sources/helpers from `@deck.gl/carto`: `VectorTileLayer`, `H3TileLayer`, `QuadbinTileLayer`, `ClusterTileLayer`, `HeatmapTileLayer`, `RasterTileLayer`, `PointLabelLayer`. Generic deck.gl layers are **not accepted**.

**Audience:** an LLM agent composing a `view_map` deck.gl declarative spec.

## 0. Before you pick anything

**Know the data.** Use `describe` rather than guessing — two-step flow:

| Step | How |
|---|---|
| Schema — what columns and types? | `describe({ connection_name, table_fqn })` (or with `query` for a SQL source). Returns `{ source, schema: [{name, type}, …], geomField?, geometryType?, rowCount? }`. Use `geomField` to identify the geometry column — **do NOT style by it**. |
| Stats — what's the column distribution? | `describe({ connection_name, column, table_fqn })` (or with `query`). Discriminated by `type`: `Number` returns `{ min, max, avg, sum, quantiles[N] }`; `String` / `Boolean` returns `{ categories: [{ category, frequency }, …] }`; `Timestamp` returns `{ min, max }`. |
| Is it skewed? | Inspect `quantiles[10]`. If `q[5] - q[0] << q[9] - q[5]`, right-skewed (typical for counts, revenue, population, incidents). |

**Schema-mode fallbacks.** `describe` schema mode requires a geometry column on the source. It FAILS (400 from the backend) for:
- **Pure analytical queries** (aggregations that drop `geom`, projections without geometry) — `describe` the base table(s) instead and reason about the projection.
- **Spatial-index tables (h3 / quadbin) and tilesets / rasters** — fall back to `list_resources({ fqn })` for schema. Stats-mode `describe` DOES work on h3 / quadbin tables; pass `spatial_data_type: "h3" | "h3int" | "quadbin"` alongside `column`.

**Synthetic `_carto_point_density`.** On Point sources, schema mode always includes a `_carto_point_density` column — server-side per-tile point count maps-api injects for use with aggregated styling. NOT a real column (don't query it via SQL) but IS valid as `attr` for `colorBins` / `colorContinuous`. Useful for density styling on dense point tilesets at low zoom.

**Name the hook.** One sentence: *"Population is concentrated in the southeast."* The hook governs four downstream decisions: layer (§1), classification (§5), palette (§6), anti-patterns to avoid (§9).

**The cartographic principle — match palette family to measure character.** Foundational thematic cartography (Brewer / ColorBrewer / MacEachren). Three families, three data shapes:

- **Qualitative** → unordered categories. **Distinct hues**, no implied ordering.
- **Sequential** → ordered magnitude. **One hue family, light→dark or dark→light**, implies *more* in one direction.
- **Diverging** → signed deviation around a midpoint. **Two hue families meeting at a neutral midpoint**, implies *zero matters*.

Crossing families misrepresents the data. Pick the family from the data's character; pick the specific palette (named or custom RGBA) by fit — basemap tone, colorblind safety, hue connotation.

---

## 1. Pick the layer

Each CARTO layer is hardcoded to a tiling scheme — see the `view_map` tool description's compatibility matrix. The cartographic question here is *which one tells the story*:

| Story | Layer | Source |
|---|---|---|
| "Where are these things?" — individual features | `VectorTileLayer` (point/line/polygon) | `vector*Source` or `boundary*Source` |
| "Where is the spatial pattern of magnitude?" — bin counts/sums/averages by area | `H3TileLayer` (isotropic) **or** `QuadbinTileLayer` (faster joins) | `h3*Source` / `quadbin*Source` with `aggregationExp` |
| "Where is the density?" — soft continuous gradient | `HeatmapTileLayer` | `h3*Source` or `quadbin*Source` |
| "Where do points cluster, how many in each?" — discrete clusters | `ClusterTileLayer` | `h3*Source` or `quadbin*Source` |
| "What's the value of this continuous surface?" — elevation, NDVI, land class | `RasterTileLayer` | `rasterSource` |
| Place name labels on top of another layer | `PointLabelLayer` (text-only; pair with `VectorTileLayer`) | Same `vector*Source` (often a filtered query) |

**H3 vs Quadbin:** prefer **H3** when the takeaway is shape/extent (organic, equal-area, no axis bias). Prefer **Quadbin** for joins to other quadbin tilesets or national tile schemes.

**Heatmap vs Cluster vs H3:**
- `HeatmapTileLayer` — smooth, soft. Good for "the broad pattern". No discrete cell value to hover.
- `ClusterTileLayer` — discrete clusters; hover shows aggregated `properties` and a `stats` object with cluster-wide aggregations.
- `H3TileLayer` — discrete cells at fixed resolution; hover shows cell values from `aggregationExp` outputs.

**Point overplotting at low zoom on `VectorTileLayer`** (raw points become a black blob below ~zoom 8 in dense areas):
- Add `pointRadiusUnits: "pixels"` + `pointRadiusMinPixels: 2` + `pointRadiusMaxPixels: 8`.
- Or switch to `H3TileLayer` with `aggregationExp: "COUNT(*) AS n"` and color by `n`.
- Or pair with `HeatmapTileLayer` underneath for density context.

---

## 2. Drawing order — bottom to top

deck.gl renders layers in **array order**: index 0 paints first (deepest), the highest index paints last (on top). There is **no `zIndex` / `renderOrder` prop** — reorder the `layers` array.

The cartographic rule: **layers that cover more pixels go to the bottom; sparse features go on top.** Raster and heatmap surfaces tile the entire viewport. H3 / quadbin cells tile wall-to-wall at their aggregation. Polygons cover their bounds. Lines are thin strokes. Points are sparse dots. Labels go last so collision detection runs against the final scene.

Conventional order, bottom → top:

1. **Continuous surfaces** — `RasterTileLayer`, `HeatmapTileLayer`.
2. **Polygons / cells** — `H3TileLayer`, `QuadbinTileLayer`, polygon-geometry `VectorTileLayer`.
3. **Lines** — line-geometry `VectorTileLayer`.
4. **Points** — point-geometry `VectorTileLayer`, `ClusterTileLayer`.
5. **Labels** — `PointLabelLayer`.

**Violations to avoid:**
- Points beneath a polygon fill — eye reads the polygon as the headline, points are missed.
- Labels mid-stack — subsequent layers paint over them.
- Two `H3TileLayer`s of the same data at different resolutions — the higher one obscures the lower.

---

## 3. Pick the visual channel

CARTO accessors that drive visual channels:

| Channel | Accessor / prop | Helper or expression |
|---|---|---|
| Color (fill) | `getFillColor` | `colorBins` / `colorContinuous` / `colorCategories` helpers, constant `[r,g,b,a]`, or `@@=` ternary |
| Color (stroke) | `getLineColor` | Same as fill |
| Size (point radius) | `getPointRadius` + `pointRadiusUnits` (`'pixels' | 'meters'`) + min/max | `@@=` expression (no `colorBins`-style helper for size) |
| Size (line width) | `getLineWidth` + `lineWidthUnits` + min/max | `@@=` expression |
| 3D extrusion | `getElevation` + `elevationScale` (H3/Quadbin when `extruded: true`) | `@@=` expression |
| Layer opacity | `opacity` (0–1, layer-level) | constant; **don't use opacity to encode values** — reserve for hierarchy/design |

**Primary-channel rule:** color carries the headline. Size carries a secondary supporting measure. Don't double-encode the same column on color and size — wastes a channel.

**Pixel-units idiom:** for any size accessor that should remain visually consistent at every zoom, set units to `"pixels"` and clamp with min/max:

```jsonc
"pointRadiusUnits": "pixels",
"getPointRadius": "@@=properties.weight / 100",
"pointRadiusMinPixels": 2,
"pointRadiusMaxPixels": 12
```

Without min/max, points balloon at high zoom and disappear at low zoom. The default `"meters"` scales with zoom and is rarely what you want for symbology.

### 3.1 Opacity as a design lever

Opacity is set via the layer-level `opacity` prop. It does three jobs on fill layers (H3, quadbin, polygon, heatmap, cluster):

1. **Lets the basemap breathe** — at default `opacity: 1` cell layers cover the basemap entirely; the map reads as data floating in void.
2. **Sets visual weight and hierarchy** — a saturated `0.9` layer feels heavy and dominant; a `0.5` layer recedes. In multi-layer maps, use opacity to choose which layer the eye lands on first.
3. **Reveals density through overlap** — where features overlap, lower opacity blends them so the eye reads "more here".

**Default to `0.7`** when you have no specific reason to deviate — basemap breathes enough, layer reads as primary. The full range `0.4–0.8` opens up when you have a reason:

- `0.4–0.5` when the basemap carries critical orientation (city grid, coastline, roads), when the layer should recede (e.g. background context layer in a multi-layer stack), or when overlap density is itself the signal.
- `0.7–0.8` when the layer is the unambiguous hero.

For points, opacity is set via the alpha channel in the color array (`[r, g, b, alpha]`) rather than a layer-level prop. Same principles: default to ~`220` (≈0.85); lower to ~`150` when points overlap heavily so density reads through blending.

---

## 4. Stroke conventions

Default for most CARTO layers is **`stroked: false`, `filled: true`** for polygons/cells. Adding stroke is a deliberate choice:

| Situation | Stroke |
|---|---|
| Light fills on light basemap | **Add stroke** in a darker shade than the fill so cells separate. |
| Dark/saturated fills on dark basemap | **Add a light stroke** to separate adjacent cells. |
| Tiny polygons at low zoom (<10 pixels each) | **Skip stroke** — outlines collapse into noise. |
| `H3TileLayer` / `QuadbinTileLayer` covering most of the viewport | **Skip stroke** — adjacent cells share boundaries; outlines double-paint. |
| Single-feature highlight (focus polygon) | **Add a thicker stroke** in a contrasting hue. |
| Points that should pop against a busy basemap | **Add a halo stroke** (white-ish, `lineWidthMinPixels: 1`). |

**Line widths:** `lineWidthUnits: "pixels"` + `lineWidthMinPixels: 1` + `lineWidthMaxPixels: 4` for context lines, more for headline lines.

**Stroke on dense choropleths — derive from the fill.** When a polygon or cell layer has many small features in the viewport (admin sub-levels, postcodes, parcels, dense h3 / quadbin cells), a contrasting stroke pulls attention away from the data-driven fill. Bind `getLineColor` to the same column as `getFillColor` with a darker variant of the fill colors. Skip stroke entirely when cells are wall-to-wall.

**Stroke as encoding** (rare): drive `getLineColor` from a different column than `getFillColor` for two-axis stories. Use sparingly; second visual channel competes for attention.

---

## 5. Classify the data

Three color helpers map to three scale types:

| Helper | Scale | When |
|---|---|---|
| `colorBins` | Threshold (`d3.scaleThreshold`) — discrete buckets | Most numeric data. Pair with quantile breakpoints from `describe`. |
| `colorContinuous` | Linear (`d3.scaleLinear`) — smooth gradient | Fine variation where every value should map to a unique color. Multi-stop arrays for diverging around a midpoint. |
| `colorCategories` | Nominal — one color per category | Strings / booleans / ordinal. Cap at 12 distinct values; aggregate the rest into "other". |

**`colorBins` workflow:**
1. `describe({ connection_name, column, table_fqn })` (or with `query`). Response shape on a numeric column: `{ type: 'Number', min, max, avg, sum, quantiles[N] }`.
2. Take `quantiles[N]` for your bucket count (4–5 is the sweet spot).
3. Drop the first and last entries (natural extremes); inner N-1 numbers are the `domain`.
4. Pick a palette by family fit (§6) — by name from the CARTOcolor registry, or a custom RGBA array of N colors.

```jsonc
"getFillColor": {
  "@@function": "colorBins",
  "attr": "population",
  "domain": [1200, 5500, 18000],
  "colors": "<sequential palette name from §6, or custom RGBA array of 4 colors>"
}
```

**Class count:** 4–5 buckets is the legibility sweet spot. 7+ pushes the eye past distinguishability. Fewer than 3 is rarely informative.

**Quantile vs custom thresholds:** default to quantile breakpoints. Override with custom thresholds when there's a meaningful policy break (e.g., `[0, 0.5, 1.0]` for shares).

**Heavy-tailed data:** if `q[9] / q[5] > 5`, quantiles compress the tail too aggressively. Either (a) precompute `LOG10(col + 1)` in `vectorQuerySource` and bin on that, or (b) switch to `colorContinuous` with a multi-stop domain anchored on the median.

**Boolean columns:** `colorCategories` doesn't match raw booleans. Cast in SQL: `SELECT *, CAST(<bool> AS STRING) AS <bool>_s FROM …` and use `domain: ["true", "false"]`.

---

## 6. Pick the palette

CARTO palettes (resolved by name in `colors`):

| Family | Use for | Available names |
|---|---|---|
| **Sequential single-hue** | Magnitude in one direction (counts, sums, populations, intensities) | `Burg`, `BurgYl`, `RedOr`, `OrYel`, `Peach`, `PinkYl`, `Mint`, `BluGrn`, `DarkMint`, `Emrld`, `BluYl`, `Teal`, `TealGrn`, `Purp`, `BrwnYl`, `Gray` |
| **Sequential multi-hue** | Same, more contrast across the range | `PurpOr`, `Sunset`, `SunsetDark`, `Magenta` |
| **Diverging** | Signed values around a meaningful midpoint (deltas, residuals, z-scores) | `ArmyRose`, `Fall`, `Geyser`, `Temps`, `TealRose`, `Tropic`, `Earth` |
| **Qualitative** | Discrete unordered categories | `Antique`, `Bold`, `Pastel`, `Prism`, `Safe`, `Vivid` |

**Colorblind-safe subset** (recommended when audience is public or unknown):
- Sequential: `Teal`, `Purp`, `Mint`, `Emrld`, `BluYl`, `DarkMint`
- Diverging: `Temps`, `Geyser`, `Tropic`
- Qualitative: `Safe`, `Vivid`

**Pick by character, not by reflex.** Once the family is right (per the §0 principle), the specific palette is a fit decision:

- **Hue connotation.** Warm hues carry *severity / heat / alarm*; cool hues carry *calm / magnitude / safe*; purple is neutral. Reach for connotation only when the measure supports it — *"risk of flood"* is warm-appropriate, *"population count"* is not.
- **Basemap tone.** Light basemap → palettes with a dark high-end stand out. Dark basemap → palettes with a bright high-end stand out (see §7).
- **Colorblind safety.** Use the subset above when audience is public or unknown.
- **Within-map distinguishability.** Multiple layers in one map need different *families*, not different shades of one (§9).

**Default if uncertain — one safe pick per family.** When no specific factor pushes you to another choice, use these as a fallback. All colorblind-safe, work on the default `positron` basemap, neutral connotations:

| Family | Default if uncertain |
|---|---|
| Sequential — magnitude | `Teal` |
| Diverging — signed | `Temps` or `Geyser` |
| Qualitative — 2–6 categories | `Bold` (or `Safe` for colorblind audiences) |
| Qualitative — 7–12 categories | `Prism` (collapse to top-N + `Other` past 12) |

**Custom palettes are valid.** Any RGBA array of the right length works — `"colors": [[60, 80, 200, 220], [120, 140, 230, 220], …]`. Use when CARTO palettes don't fit the brand / domain / luminance constraint. Named palettes are tuned for luminance ordering and colorblind safety; custom needs to be checked for the same.

**Don't reflex on a palette name.** *"What did I pick last time?"* is the wrong prompt — re-derive each map from the family principle (§0) and the data character. The defaults above are a *fallback when reasoning gives no preference*, not a reflex.

**Multi-layer hue separation:**
- One sequential + one categorical → fine.
- Two sequentials → make them different hue families (one warm, one cool — not two blues).
- Three+ data-driven layers → cap at two; the rest constants or muted boundary context.

---

## 7. Basemap pairing

Set top-level `mapStyle` to a CARTO basemap URL: `https://basemaps.cartocdn.com/gl/{name}-gl-style/style.json`.

| Basemap | Strengths | Default for |
|---|---|---|
| `positron` | Light, low-saturation, neutral. Lets data colors pop. | Most maps. The right default if the user doesn't specify. |
| `voyager` | Light but more colorful — useful labels, OSM-styled context. | When geographic context (roads, names, POIs) carries meaning. |
| `dark-matter` | Dark, high-contrast for bright/saturated data. | Heatmaps, density of bright signals (lights, fires, night population). |
| `*-nolabels` variants | Same color scheme, no place labels. | Dense data layers where labels would clutter. |

**Always emit `mapStyle`.** Without it, the renderer falls back to positron, but the spec stops being self-describing/portable.

**Palette × basemap:**
- **Light basemap** — most palettes work. Avoid very pale lower-bound colors (bottom bucket disappears into the basemap); bump alpha or pick palettes that start mid-saturation.
- **Dark basemap** — light-on-dark reads well; dark colors near `[0,0,0]` disappear. Prefer palettes that span mid-to-light, OR reverse the palette so its bright end sits at the high-value class. Diverging palettes need the dark end re-checked against the basemap.

---

## 8. Picking, highlighting, tooltips

Interactivity is part of cartography — a hover that lights up the right feature with the right info reinforces the hook.

**Pick what to make pickable:**
- **Always pickable:** the headline layer (top of stack). Set `pickable: true`.
- **Optionally pickable:** secondary layers if the user might want to inspect them. Default `pickable: false`.
- **Never pickable:** `HeatmapTileLayer` (picking returns cell properties, not density), continuous raster surfaces.

**Highlighting** (auto-on when `pickable: true`):
- `autoHighlight: true` — default when pickable.
- `highlightColor` — default `[0, 0, 0, 128]`. Override with a contrasting colour if the dark default fights your palette.

**Multi-layer tooltips** — `getTooltip` is top-level (one expression for the whole spec), but you can branch on `layer.id`:

```
"@@=object && (
  layer.id === 'cycle_network'
    ? '<b>Cycle Route</b><br>' + object.properties.route_name
    : layer.id === 'hotspots'
      ? '<b>Hotspot</b><br>Accidents: ' + object.properties.accident_count
      : '<b>' + object.properties.severity + ' accident</b>'
)"
```

Use `layer.id` (hoisted as a sibling in PickingInfo), NOT `object.layer.id`.

**Tooltip content discipline.** Keep tooltips to ≤ 5 fields. The tooltip's job is "what is this thing?", not "everything about it".

---

## 9. Anti-patterns — do not emit these

- **Hardcoded `colorBins` domain values without `describe` first.** You can't pick informed breakpoints for an unknown distribution.
- **Palette family mismatched to data character.** Sequential on signed data hides the sign; diverging on unsigned implies a midpoint that doesn't exist; sequential / diverging on a string column implies an ordering or midpoint string data rarely carries. String columns → qualitative palette.
- **Rainbow palette (`Prism`, `Vivid`) on ordered data.** Hue order doesn't match value order — readers misread.
- **More than 7 `colorBins` buckets, or more than 12 `colorCategories` values.** Eye stops distinguishing.
- **Palette reflex across sessions.** If your previous spec ended on a given palette, re-derive from the family principle this time. The answer may legitimately be the same palette, but should be a fresh fit — not a reach.
- **Multi-layer mono-culture.** Multiple layers in one map sharing the same hue family → ambiguous which is which. Distinct families per layer.
- **Mixing tile schemes** (`vectorTableSource` → `HeatmapTileLayer`, etc.). Silent empty render.
- **Encoding the same column on color and size.** Wastes a channel.
- **Three+ data-driven layers stacked.** Hierarchy collapses. Cap at two.
- **Hardcoded raster `getFillColor` ternaries with 10+ branches.** Silently fails — use range bins.
- **Function calls in `@@=` expressions.** Forbidden — no `Math.sqrt`, `.toFixed()`, template literals, optional chaining. Precompute in SQL.
- **Opacity-as-channel.** Reserve `opacity` for layer-stacking and design hierarchy (§3.1), not per-feature encoding.
- **`stroked: true` on covering H3/Quadbin layers.** Adjacent cells share boundaries; double-painting.
- **Contrasting stroke on dense small-polygon choropleths.** Edges become more prominent than the data. Derive stroke from fill or skip stroke entirely (§4).
- **Labels mid-stack** (`PointLabelLayer` not last in the layers array). Subsequent layers paint over them.
- **`getFillColor` / `getLineColor` on `HeatmapTileLayer`.** Silently ignored. Use `colorRange` + `colorDomain`.
- **Generic deck.gl layers** (`ScatterplotLayer`, `HexagonLayer`, `GeoJsonLayer`). Silently produces nothing.

## 10. Worked recipes

Three archetypal patterns. Palette choices are written as placeholders — the agent picks the specific palette by family fit per §6 (named from the registry or custom RGBA array).

### 10.1 Population density (single sequential)

```
describe({
  connection_name: "carto_dw",
  table_fqn: "carto-demo-data.demo_tables.populated_places",
  column: "pop_max"
})
// → { type: 'Number', min: 0, max: 30000000, quantiles: { 5: [0, 1500, 5000, 25000, 200000, 30000000], ... } }
// Drop first/last; inner 4 are the domain.
```

```json
{
  "initialViewState": { "latitude": 20, "longitude": 0, "zoom": 2 },
  "mapStyle": "https://basemaps.cartocdn.com/gl/positron-gl-style/style.json",
  "layers": [{
    "@@type": "VectorTileLayer",
    "id": "places",
    "pickable": true,
    "data": { "@@function": "vectorTableSource", "connectionName": "carto_dw", "tableName": "carto-demo-data.demo_tables.populated_places" },
    "getFillColor": {
      "@@function": "colorBins",
      "attr": "pop_max",
      "domain": [1500, 5000, 25000, 200000],
      "colors": "<sequential palette, picked per §6 — basemap is light, so any sequential with a dark high-end fits>"
    },
    "pointRadiusUnits": "pixels",
    "getPointRadius": 4,
    "pointRadiusMinPixels": 3,
    "pointRadiusMaxPixels": 10
  }]
}
```

### 10.2 Revenue YoY change (diverging around 0)

`describe({ ..., column: "yoy_change" })` returns `{ type: 'Number', min: -0.45, max: +0.90, avg: +0.05, ... }`. Signed → diverging.

```jsonc
"getFillColor": {
  "@@function": "colorContinuous",
  "attr": "yoy_change",
  "domain": [-0.5, 0, 1.0],
  "colors": "<diverging palette, picked per §6 — for a colorblind-safe public audience prefer Temps / Geyser / Tropic>"
}
```

Multi-stop `domain` anchors the midpoint at 0 even though `min` and `max` are asymmetric.

### 10.3 Two-layer composition — H3 magnitude + categorical points

Bottom layer (H3 population, sequential, 0.55 opacity, no stroke — recedes into context). Top layer (events, categorical, white halo for legibility — the headline).

```jsonc
"layers": [
  {
    "@@type": "H3TileLayer",
    "data": {
      "@@function": "h3TableSource",
      "connectionName": "carto_dw",
      "tableName": "carto-demo-data.demo_tables.derived_spatialfeatures_<region>_h3res8_v1_yearly_v2",
      "aggregationExp": "SUM(population) AS population"
    },
    "getFillColor": {
      "@@function": "colorBins",
      "attr": "population",
      "domain": [100, 500, 2000, 10000],
      "colors": "<sequential palette per §6 — pick a cool family so the warm categorical points on top read as the headline>"
    },
    "stroked": false,
    "opacity": 0.55
  },
  {
    "@@type": "VectorTileLayer",
    "data": { "@@function": "vectorTableSource", "connectionName": "carto_dw", "tableName": "<dataset>.events" },
    "pickable": true,
    "getFillColor": {
      "@@function": "colorCategories",
      "attr": "severity",
      "domain": ["Slight", "Serious", "Fatal"],
      "colors": "<qualitative palette per §6, OR a custom RGBA array — warm hues fit a severity axis>"
    },
    "stroked": true,
    "getLineColor": [255, 255, 255, 230],
    "lineWidthMinPixels": 0.5,
    "pointRadiusUnits": "pixels",
    "getPointRadius": 4,
    "pointRadiusMinPixels": 2,
    "pointRadiusMaxPixels": 10
  }
]
```

Different palette families per layer (sequential cool vs. categorical warm) keep them visually separable. Bottom layer at `0.55` opacity recedes (§3.1). Top layer's white halo separates points from the H3 fills.

### 10.4 Marker + label stack (`PointLabelLayer`)

`PointLabelLayer` renders text only — always pair with a `VectorTileLayer`. Use a filtered query for the label layer to avoid clutter at low zoom.

```jsonc
"layers": [
  {
    "@@type": "VectorTileLayer",
    "data": { "@@function": "vectorTableSource", "connectionName": "carto_dw", "tableName": "carto-demo-data.demo_tables.populated_places" },
    "getFillColor": [40, 80, 200, 220],
    "pointRadiusUnits": "pixels",
    "getPointRadius": 4,
    "pointRadiusMinPixels": 3
  },
  {
    "@@type": "PointLabelLayer",
    "data": { "@@function": "vectorQuerySource", "connectionName": "carto_dw", "sqlQuery": "SELECT * FROM `carto-demo-data.demo_tables.populated_places` WHERE pop_max > 100000" },
    "getText": "@@=properties.name",
    "getColor": [40, 40, 40, 255],
    "outlineColor": [255, 255, 255, 230],
    "outlineWidth": 3,
    "sizeScale": 14
  }
]
```

`PointLabelLayer` last in the array (drawing-order rule). Filter SQL keeps only large places labeled.

## Authoring checklist

Before emitting a `view_map` spec where styling is in scope:

- [ ] Did I call `describe` (schema first, then stats per column) for any unfamiliar numeric column I'm binning on? For h3 / quadbin / tileset / raster sources, did I fall back to `list_resources` for schema?
- [ ] **Does the palette family match the data character?** Sequential ↔ ordered magnitude, diverging ↔ signed, qualitative ↔ unordered. String columns → qualitative (§6, §9).
- [ ] Is the specific palette a fresh fit per map — not a reflex from the previous spec? If uncertain: `Teal` (sequential), `Temps` / `Geyser` (diverging), `Bold` / `Safe` (qualitative) — see §6 defaults. Custom RGBA arrays also valid.
- [ ] Colorblind-safe palette if audience is public or unknown (§6 subset)?
- [ ] Does the basemap pair well with the palette (no light colors lost on light basemap, no dark colors lost on dark) (§7)?
- [ ] Are layer-source schemes compatible (per the `view_map` tool description's matrix)?
- [ ] If H3/quadbin source: did I include `aggregationExp`?
- [ ] Layers ordered bottom-to-top: surface → polygons → lines → points → labels (§2)?
- [ ] Multi-layer: ≤ 2 data-driven, distinct hue families, opacity-stacked, headline layer pickable (§6, §3.1)?
- [ ] Stroke: `stroked: false` for covering tile layers; on points, white halo if needed; on dense small-polygon choropleths, derive stroke from fill (§4)?
- [ ] Pixel-units idiom: `pointRadiusUnits` / `lineWidthUnits` set to `"pixels"` with min/max clamps (§3)?
- [ ] Opacity fits the layer's role (§3.1) — `0.4–0.5` for recede / basemap-context, `0.7–0.8` for hero, not a fixed default?
- [ ] If `HeatmapTileLayer`: `getWeight` set, `colorRange` + `colorDomain` set (not `getFillColor`)?
- [ ] If `RasterTileLayer`: `getFillColor` ternary handles the nodata sentinel for the band's dtype?
- [ ] If `PointLabelLayer`: paired with a `VectorTileLayer`, filtered, last in the layers array?
- [ ] `mapStyle` set explicitly to a CARTO basemap URL?
- [ ] `getTooltip` uses `layer.id` for multi-layer dispatch (not `object.layer.id`)?
- [ ] Bucket / category count within legibility limits (≤ 7 numeric buckets, ≤ 12 categories)?
- [ ] Plan to emit an HTML legend after the render — via a widget tool if available, else inline HTML — per the `view_map` tool description's LEGEND section?
