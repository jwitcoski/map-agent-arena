# Trade Area Analysis

Builds CARTO Workflows that define catchment areas around candidate locations, enrich them with data, and score/rank locations for site selection, billboard placement, or coverage analysis.

**Prerequisites**: Load `carto-create-workflow` for the development process, JSON structure, and validation commands.

---

## Instructions

A trade area workflow always follows this pipeline:

```
Candidate Locations → (Filter) → Catchment Areas → Spatial Index → Enrich → Aggregate → Score/Rank → Save
```

### Step 1: Load Candidate Locations

Use `native.gettablebyname` to load stores, billboards, POIs, or any point dataset representing candidate locations.

**Success**: Node outputs a table with a geometry column (e.g. `geom`) and a unique location identifier.

### Step 2: Filter/Limit Candidates (optional)

Use `native.wheresimplified` to narrow candidates (e.g. specific city, category). Use `native.orderby` + `native.limit` for top-N by a metric (e.g. top 50 by revenue).

**Success**: Output contains only the candidate subset relevant to the analysis. Reducing candidates early prevents combinatorial explosion downstream.

### Step 3: Generate Catchment Areas

Choose the catchment method based on the use case:

| Method | Component | When to use | Key params |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Isochrones | `native.isolines` | Site selection, retail — realistic road-network areas | `mode`: car/walk; `type`: time/distance; `range`: seconds or meters |
| Buffers | `native.buffer` | Billboard coverage, proximity — simple geometric circles | `distance`: meters |

**Isochrones vs Buffers**: Isochrones follow the road network and produce realistic catchment shapes but require a CARTO LDS API call. Buffers are purely geometric circles — simpler and faster, suitable for proximity analysis or billboard coverage.

**Success**: Each candidate location has an associated polygon representing its catchment area.

### Step 4: Convert Catchment to Spatial Index

Use `native.h3polyfill` or `native.quadbinpolyfill` to tessellate catchment polygons into grid cells. The resolution must match the enrichment dataset you plan to use.

**Success**: Output contains one row per grid cell per location, with both the spatial index column and the location identifier preserved.

### Step 5: Enrich with Data

Join grid cells with a spatial features dataset or use `native.h3enrich`:
- **JOIN approach**: `native.joinv2` or `native.spatialjoin` with a pre-indexed enrichment table
- **Enrich approach**: `native.h3enrich` to pull variables from CARTO's Data Observatory

**Success**: Each grid cell row has enrichment variables (e.g. population, income, foot traffic) attached.

### Step 6: Aggregate Back to Locations

Use `native.groupby` to collapse grid-cell rows back to one row per location:
- **Group by**: the location identifier column
- **Aggregation**: `population,sum,income,avg` (comma-separated column,method pairs)

**Success**: Output has one row per candidate location with aggregated enrichment metrics.

### Step 7: Score and Rank

Three-part scoring pattern:

1. **Normalize** each variable to [0,1] using `native.normalize` (one call per variable, or chain multiple)
2. **Composite score** via `native.selectexpression`: weighted addition of normalized variables, e.g. `normalized_population * 0.4 + normalized_income * 0.3 + normalized_traffic * 0.3`
3. **Rank** using `native.orderby` (descending by composite score) + `native.limit` (top N)

**Success**: Output is a ranked list of candidate locations with a composite score and the contributing normalized variables.

### Step 8: Save

Use `native.saveastable` to persist the ranked results.

**Success**: Validated workflow that can be uploaded via `carto workflows create`.

## Gotchas

- **Provider casing & SQL dialect.** This skill uses lowercase column names (`geom`, `population`, `income`, `normalized_population`, etc.) — BigQuery / Databricks / Postgres / Redshift convention. On Snowflake, unquoted identifiers surface UPPERCASE — reference them as `GEOM`, `POPULATION`, `INCOME`, `NORMALIZED_POPULATION`. See `carto-create-workflow/references/providers/<provider>.md` for casing rules and SQL dialect equivalents.
- Isochrone and route components call CARTO's LDS API — they require a valid connection with API access enabled. Buffers do not.
- Cross Join for distance matrices can explode with many locations x many grid cells. Filter and limit candidates first (Step 2) to keep the pipeline manageable.
- H3 resolution must match the enrichment dataset resolution. Check the enrichment table's index column before choosing resolution.
- Buffer distance is in **meters**. Isoline range is in **seconds** (for `type=time`) or **meters** (for `type=distance`).
- The `native.commercialhotspots` component expects `variablecolumns` as a Python-style list string (`['col1', 'col2']`) and `weights` as comma-separated values — inconsistent with other components.
- When aggregating enrichment back to locations (Step 6), ensure the GROUP BY uses the **location identifier**, not the grid cell index. Grouping by the grid cell produces per-cell results instead of per-location.
- When using `native.h3distance` for competitor proximity, the output is grid-based. Join it back to the location table to get per-location distance metrics.

## Reference Templates

These files are working examples in this skill directory:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `isochrones_from_points.json` | Retail stores in Boston — 5-min walk-time isochrones via LDS API. `native.isolines` is on v2 (lowercase wire-value `mode` list, `customoptions` / `traveltime_*` inputs). |
| `identify_best_billboards.json` | Billboard site scoring — buffer, enrich, normalize, weighted composite score, top-N |
| `commercial_hotspots.json` | Commercial hotspot detection — H3 distance to competitors, weighted hotspot analysis |

**Refreshing component versions.** These templates pin each node's `data.version` to whatever was current when the template was harvested. When a native component bumps versions (e.g. `native.isolines` v1 → v2 added new transport modes plus `customoptions` and `traveltime_*` inputs), the older template still parses but will flag `verify-remote` warnings and miss new inputs. To refresh: run `carto workflows components get <component> --connection <conn> --json`, then update the node's `data.version` and `inputs` array in lockstep against the live schema. Always cross-reference `Selection` input values against `carto-create-workflow/SKILL.md` — `components get` may surface display labels under the `options` key, but wire values are typically the lowercase / snake_case forms.

## Common Variations

| Variant | How |
|---------|-----|
| Retail site selection | Isochrones (walk/drive) -> H3 polyfill -> enrich with demographics -> score by population + income |
| Billboard/OOH placement | Buffers -> H3 polyfill -> enrich with audience/traffic -> normalize + weighted score -> top-N |
| Commercial hotspot detection | H3 grid -> `native.h3distance` for competitor proximity -> `native.commercialhotspots` with weights and p-value threshold |
| Drive-time coverage analysis | Isochrones (car, multiple ranges) -> union -> dissolve to find total coverage area |
| Walk-time catchment comparison | Isochrones (walk, 5/10/15 min) -> enrich each band -> compare population captured per band |
| Franchise territory planning | Isochrones per candidate -> check overlap -> filter non-overlapping set -> score remaining |
