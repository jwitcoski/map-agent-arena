# App routing rubric — Builder vs. custom deck.gl app

ArcGIS Dashboards, Web Experiences (Experience Builder), and Web Mapping Applications (Configurable Apps, Instant Apps, Map Viewer templates, Web AppBuilder) come in two shapes:

- **Simple apps** — the entire interactive surface is a map plus widgets that CARTO Builder offers natively (legend, layer list, basemap switcher, search, measurement, plus a small number of analytical widgets like pie / histogram / range / timeseries / table / formula).
- **Custom apps** — the app uses widgets Builder doesn't cover, OR shows more than 4 widgets simultaneously, OR has a layout that doesn't reduce to a single Builder map.

The discover phase applies this rubric to every Dashboard, Web Experience, and Web Mapping Application item it finds, records the decision on the manifest entry, and routes simple apps to the maps migration phase (absorbed into the embedded Web Map's Builder map) and custom apps to the future app migration phase.

## Decision

```
For each Dashboard, Web Experience, or Web Mapping Application:
  fetch the item's `data` payload
    GET /sharing/rest/content/items/<id>/data?f=json
  enumerate detected widgets per item type (see "Where widgets live" below)
  count max widgets visible simultaneously on any single page or layout
    (exclude map controls — see "Map controls" table below)
  for each detected widget: look up its Builder equivalent

  if any detected widget has no Builder equivalent
      → custom app   (Recommended path: carto-arcgis-migrate-apps)
  elif max-visible-widgets > 4
      → custom app   (Recommended path: carto-arcgis-migrate-apps)
  else
      → simple app   (Recommended path: carto-arcgis-migrate-maps)
```

By type:

- **Dashboards** typically fail the rubric (≥ 5 widgets is the design intent).
- **Experience Builder** experiences pass more often, especially when the app's purpose is "show a map with standard controls and one or two analytical widgets."
- **Web Mapping Applications** vary widely. **Instant Apps** and **Map Viewer-based templates** are usually wrappers over a Web Map with map controls and a search bar — they pass the rubric. **Configurable Apps** (older "Basic Viewer", "Public Information", etc.) are similar. **Web AppBuilder (WAB)** apps are heavier — they often include Edit, Geoprocessing, 3D, or custom widgets that have no Builder equivalent and route to the future app migration phase.

## ArcGIS widget → CARTO Builder equivalent

### Map controls — always available, never counted toward the cap

| ArcGIS widget / control | Builder equivalent |
|---|---|
| Layer list | Builder layer panel |
| Legend | Builder legend |
| Basemap gallery / switcher | Builder basemap selector |
| Search | Builder search bar |
| Measurement | Builder measure tool |
| Zoom / Home / Locate / Compass | Builder map controls |
| Print | Builder export-to-image |
| Bookmarks | Builder bookmarks |
| Header / sidebar / text panel | Builder map title + description (informational only) |

### Analytical widgets — counted toward the cap

| ArcGIS widget | Builder equivalent | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `pie-chart` / Pie chart | `pie` widget | available |
| `serial-chart` (single series) | `timeseries` (if temporal) or `histogram` (if categorical) | available |
| `serial-chart` (multi-series) | — | **not available** |
| Histogram | `histogram` widget | available |
| Range slider / numeric filter | `range` widget | available |
| `timeseries` / temporal slider | `timeseries` widget | available |
| `indicator` / KPI | `formula` widget | available |
| `list` / record list | `table` widget | available |
| `table` / attribute table | `table` widget | available |
| `details` / record detail | popup or info panel | available |
| Filter (attribute filter, single column) | SQL parameter (`Category` / `NumericRange` / `DateRange`) | available |
| `embedded-content` / iframe widget | — | **not available** |
| Custom script widget | — | **not available** |
| Print-report widget | — | **not available** |
| Survey widget (Survey123) | — | **not available** |

When a widget type isn't in this table, treat as **not available** and route to `migrate-apps` — the rubric is conservative on unknowns.

## Where widgets live in the item `data` payload

Different app types store their widget configurations in different shapes. The agent reads the `data` payload once and enumerates widgets per the item's type and `typeKeywords`:

| Item type | `typeKeywords` hint | Where to find widgets |
|---|---|---|
| `Dashboard` | — | `data.widgets[]` (flat list); `data.headerPanel`, `data.sidebar`, `data.leftPanel` for non-counted text/header panels |
| `Web Experience` | — | walk `data.pages[]` → each page's `layouts[]` → `widgets[]` and `widgetIds[]`; `data.widgets` is also a flat dictionary keyed by widget id |
| `Web Mapping Application` | `Configurable` | `data.values` — the configured widget set varies per template; common keys include `legendShown`, `layerListShown`, `searchEnabled`, `bookmarksEnabled`. Treat each true flag as one map-control entry |
| `Web Mapping Application` | `Instant App` | `data.draft` (or `data` if published) — Instant App config schema varies per template (Sidebar, Nearby, Atlas, Insets, Minimalist, etc.). Walk `tools[]` / `widgets[]` / `expressions[]` per template |
| `Web Mapping Application` | `WAB2D` / `WAB3D` | `data.widgetPool.widgets[]` (off-screen catalog) and `data.widgetOnScreen.widgets[]` (visible). Only count `widgetOnScreen` toward the cap |
| `Web Mapping Application` | `Story Map` | Treat as gap (`out-of-scope-v1`) at the item-types level — do not enter the rubric |

When `typeKeywords` is ambiguous or empty, prefer the conservative fallback: enumerate `data.values` and `data.widgetOnScreen.widgets[]` if present; if neither yields a clean widget list, classify as `custom-app` and note `unknown Web Mapping Application subtype` in the manifest entry's `Notes:`.

## What "max visible widgets" means

- **Dashboard**: count widgets on the single dashboard layout. Header / sidebar text panels don't count; map controls don't count.
- **Web Experience**: evaluate each page independently; the max across all pages is the number used. Tabbed views inside a single page count the tab with the most simultaneously-visible widgets (not the sum across tabs). Pop-up dialogs that appear only on user action don't count.
- **Web Mapping Application**: count widgets that are visible on initial load. Map controls don't count. Off-screen widgets in WAB's `widgetPool` don't count (only `widgetOnScreen` does). Pop-up panels that open on user action don't count. For Instant Apps, count any panel/section that's visible alongside the map by default.

## What gets recorded on the manifest entry

After applying the rubric, the discover skill writes the following fields onto the app's manifest entry (see [`manifest-format.md`](manifest-format.md)):

- `App profile:` — one-line summary of detected widgets and which are Builder-available.
- `Max visible widgets:` — the count.
- `Routing decision:` — `builder` or `custom-app`.
- For `builder` decisions: `Source Web Map:` pointing at the embedded Web Map's item ID — the map `migrate-maps` will turn into a Builder map (with the relevant Builder widgets enabled).
- For `custom-app` decisions: a short reason in `Notes:` explaining which rule fired (e.g. `embedded-content widget not available` or `7 widgets visible — > 4 cap`).

## Tuning

The 4-widget cap is a heuristic — Builder's right-hand panel comfortably shows 3 to 4 widgets simultaneously without scrolling on a typical desktop viewport. The cap can be overridden per migration: edit the manifest after `discover` runs and before `migrate-maps` / `migrate-apps` is invoked. Flip `Routing decision:` (and `Recommended path:` accordingly) and the downstream skills honor the override.
